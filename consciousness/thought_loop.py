"""
consciousness/thought_loop.py — Continuous background thought generation.

Every 30–120 seconds (randomized), the AI:
1. Checks the environment (silence, time)
2. Picks a random memory or pending event
3. Generates a short internal thought via LLM
4. Sometimes (config.SPEAK_THOUGHT_PROB) speaks the thought aloud
5. Updates internal_state.current_thought in MongoDB
